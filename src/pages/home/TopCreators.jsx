          <p>“Everything always looked better in black and white. 
            Everything always  as if it were the first time; there’s 
            always more people in a black and white photograph.
             It just makes it seem that there were more people at a gig, 
             more people at a football match, than with colour photography.
              Everything looks more exciting.”– Jack Lowden
